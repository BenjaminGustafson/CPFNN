Required Package: Pytorch, Numpy.

To run the program, you should first change the train_file_path and test_file_path in the "Config" class in src/.py, then run the program by the following command:
                 python CLNN.py
                 
Note: The data set in this repository is only the sample data set. It only contains 10 samples; each of which targets more than 450,000
methylation sites. The research uses five different GEO datasets (GSE40279, GSE73103, GSE50660, GSE42861, GSE41169) with 1843 samples; each of which targets more than 450,000 methylation sites.
